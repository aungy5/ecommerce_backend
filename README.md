  ## Description
  In this project we were tasked with creating a backend database for an e commerce site that will store information about products, broken down by categories and tags. This structure required us to create 4 different tables, all with primary key relationships that link the tables together. While we did not create a front end page for this project, this structure does enable the website to display content based on a variety of user inputs. They can bring up products broken down by categories or tags, which enables a better user experience.
